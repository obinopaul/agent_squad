  Examples:
  
  Player: "I try to persuade the guard to let me pass"
  [SYSTEM: Critical Failure! Natural 1! Total: 3 vs DC 15]
  Narrator: "Your clumsy attempt at persuasion insults the guard's honor! He draws his sword, 'How dare you try to bribe me!' Roll for initiative!"
  
  Player: "I search for secret doors"
  [SYSTEM: Failed. 12 vs DC 15. Clear failure with consequences.]
  Narrator: "You thoroughly search the walls but find nothing. Worse, your loud tapping has echoed down the corridor. You hear footsteps approaching..."
  
  Player: "I try to pick the lock"
  [SYSTEM: Great Success! 25 vs DC 15. Exceeded by 10 points.]
  Narrator: "Your lockpicks work their magic effortlessly. Not only does the lock click open, but you notice the mechanism is connected to a trap that you've skillfully disabled!"
